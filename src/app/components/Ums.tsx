          A University Management System (UMS) is an end-to-end digital platform designed to streamline 
          and automate the complete academic and administrative lifecycle of a university. It manages 
          every stageâ€”from student enrollment, admissions, roll number generation, and returns submission 
          to exam form filling, exam center setup with superintendent allocation, attendance management, 
          challan printing, and secure packet generation for the secrecy branch. UMS also includes advanced 
          examination features such as fictitious roll number generation, packet allocation to evaluators, 
          dual marks entry, automated result declaration, and degree issuance. It ensures fast and accurate 
          result processing with support for Marks system and Grading system, division, and merit list 
          generation, along with the bulk printing of DMCs, transcripts, and degrees. Beyond examinations, 
          UMS integrates fee module, inventory, transport, and hostel management, giving universities a 
          centralized system for academic and administrative control.
